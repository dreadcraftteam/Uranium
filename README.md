## Uranium
This is an engine written in C using SDL and OpenGL. The engine is divided into several parts (launcher, game, engine) for ease of working with it. Also, if you find an error or bug, please report it to the [issues](https://github.com/dreadcraftteam/Uranium/issues) section. Currently, compilation is supported only on Linux and only on x86.


Pull requests are welcome!

## How to Build
1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
2. Clone repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/dreadcraftteam/Uranium.git

4. Inside the cloned directory, run the compilation by running this file:
```
release.sh
```
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or this one if you need to compile to debug:
```

```
5. Navigate to `dist`, there will be a compiled build of the engine.
6. Thats All!
